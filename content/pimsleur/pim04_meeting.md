# S1: Sir did I just hear you speaking kinruu.

Here is how to say "To Hear" In Kinruu.
 (peja)

To make a verb completed, we can use "" shei.
 (shei)

Try to say "I heard"
  (bendi peshei)

Try to say "You spoke Kinruu"
   (fedi kinruufa ruushei)

Here is how to say "I heard you speak kinruu"

(fedi kinruufa ruugefa bendi peshei)

The magic that makes this work is adding  to the end of a verb. It turns the whole verb clause it into the object of the bigger clause.  Of course this requires that everthing needed for this clause comes before the verb.

Listen again.
    
(fedi kinruufa ruugefa bendi peshei)

The structure is something like this:
You Kinruu speak I heard

Try to say it as a question?
