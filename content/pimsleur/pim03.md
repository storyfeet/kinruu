# S1: Excuse me sir, here is your tea.
Can you remember how to say "Excuse me"?
 (thunhilge)

In Kinruu the closest word to "Sir" or "Madam" is "Honourable Soul"
 (tsanbes)

Note that in this case it doesn't have a marker. at the end.  This is because it is being used to call out to the person. Sometimes called the "Vocative"

Try to say "Excuse me sir"
 . (thunhilge tsanbes)

Here is how to say "Here"
 (shebos)

That is Literally "This location". Try to say "Is here"
 (shebosdes)

Do you remember how to say "Speaker of Kinruu"?
  (kinruuko vuruu)

  (feko jaironfa)

   (feko jairondi shebosdes)

# S2 : Ah thankyou. Hold on your thumb is in my tea.

 (thunthange)

To say "To wait" we say:


To say "Wait" we say


How would you say, "I wait"
 

The word for Thumb is "Finger one"
 (shaidei)

  (feko shaidei)

Say "My tea"
  (benko jairon)

   (benko jaironko chobos)

  (gaiko chobos)

#s3: Don't worry, it's quite cool.

Here is how to say "To Worry"
 (chotsuja)

The kinruu word for ice is "" (jan)
to say "is cool" we can say:
 (chiujandes)

Try to say "The milk is cool"
  (gaidi chiujandes)

Now "Don't worry, the tea is cool"
    (dai chotsudanba, jairondi chiujandes)

Of course if the subject is obvious from context, it can be omitted.

Try "Dont worry. It's cool." referring to the tea.
 . .(dai chotsudanba. chiujandes.)

# Ending

Now listen to the conversation from the beginning of this lesson. If you are able to follow it, you are ready to move on to the next lesson.

....

Dont worry if you need to do a lesson a few times for the core vocab to go in.  Language learning takes time.

This is the end of lesson three.
