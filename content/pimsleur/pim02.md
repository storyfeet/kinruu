 (shoudanja)

Now try "I dont have"

  (bendi shoudange)

How about "I dont have Milk" Literally "I no milk, don't have"

    (bendi dai gaifa shoudange)

How about "I Dont have cream"

   (dai gaishaifa shoudange)

To make a "how about" suggestion, one can simply ask, "is good".

  (gesdes ma)

Try to say "How about cream" Literally "Is cream good"
