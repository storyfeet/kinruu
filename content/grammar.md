Grammar Introduction
------------

### Normal structure

In Kinruu, words are built from a set of roots, but the same set of roots can mean quite different things in different cases.

	 (honmoi - fire grain) as a noun, represents "meal", but as a verb means "to cook".

To distinguish these, **"Role Markers"** are added to the end of words, to communicate their role in the sentence.

	  
	I_ meal_ cook_
	I cook the meal

In the above sentence:

*  (dee) marks "I"/"" as the subject of the sentence.
*  (ta) marks the first  as the direct object and therefor a noun
*  (geh) marks the second  as a simple verb

### Types of Root.

In Kiruu, there are 4 Kinds of Root.
* Basic Roots
	* Have a core meaning found in nature such as body parts, or natural phenomena.
	* Are often associated to a more abstract meaning such as desire, or effort.
	* Can take on several meanings in different contexts.
* Role markers
	* Always occur at the end of words.
	* Never occur at the start or in the middle of words.
	* Give the word it's job in the sentence.
* Modifiers
	* Come at the start of a word and change it's meaning.
	* Are sometimes allowed in the middle of a word.
	* Contain abstract meanings such as "Plurality", "Colour", "Size"
* Special Grammar markers.
	*  :Clause marker.
	*  :Spoken quote.
	*  :Spoken question mark.
	*  :Spoken Escape, allows for describing the grammar and words in Kinruu.

### Word Order

Normally clauses are ended in a verb. All words that belong to a verb come before it, however as the marker defines their role the exact order can be adjusted for emphasis.

### Double marking

A word can take on multiple roles in a sentence. This is called **"Double marking"**.

	 
	I_ hit_
	I hit myself

If a verb is double marked, then everything belonging to that verb is treated as a single item in a larger sentence.

	    
	I_ water_ swim_ want_
	I want to swim in water.

In the above sentence  (I - subject) Is the active subject of both the inner and outer clauses.  It might be closer to translate as "I want that I swim in water"

	   
	I_ you_ swim_ want_
	I want that you swim

Here the inner  attaches to the inner verb.


All Role Markers
-------------

Finish a word giving the role in the sentence

### verbs:

All sentences end with one of the following.

Simple:     
infinitive (purpose):    
Soft Imperative (request):    
Hard imperative (Command):    
Is:    
Is not:

All other forms can be negated using  before the role

	eg: "Doesn't go"    
	 "Don't go"    

When using  for "is not" the item is preceded with a 

	      
	I_ car_ _red_    
	My car is not red    

	      
	I_ car_ green_
	My car is green

### Nouns

Subject (Doer):    
Object (Done to):    

### Adjectives

Adjective items come before the item they modify

Descriptor:    
Like (This noun):
With (Having this noun):    
Doing (verb as adjective):    
Possessive:    
Position, as, in place of:    
Along with (together):    

### Extra Information

Can come anywhere in a sentence

To:    
From, Because of:    
By, By means of:    
Extra info, Aside, Isolate:    

### Topic

The Topic normally begins a sentence/clause. Lets the listener know what is important about the sentence. May or may not be an item in the sentence.

Topic / Highlight / As for: ,

	   
	I_ you_ have_ can_
	As for me, \[I say] you can have \[it]

	   
	car_ I_ drive_ can_
	As for cars, you can drive mine.

### Time markers.

before:,
at:,
after:,

These marker can apply apply to verbs "when I go" "I go" or to time prases.
Time phrases begin with any of

* number:,  ...
* Quantities:, , 
* that/this: ,

and end in the time markers.

###  Question

Question:    

###  goh

To avoid ambiguity, sometimes it is helpful to add an "inner clause" start marker. This is done with 

 	          
	I_  today_ you_ swim_ want_    
	I want you to swim today.

	         
	I_ today_  you_ swim_ want_    
	Today, I want you to swim.

In the second sentence, "Today" Applies to my desire, not to the swim, the swim can happen at any future time.

a  clause is ended by the first "double marked" word to follow it.

### That which ..

 is the only word that can come after a verb and still belong to it. That is because it joins an inner clause to an outer clause, performing a role like "that which"

After a verb,  has 2 role markers following it. It allows an item defined in an inner clause to be used in an outer clause.

This takes two forms

	a) ... verb_ _role1_role1 ... verb2    

	b) ... verb_ item__role1_role2 ... verb2

This joins turns the item that would be \<role 1> in the inner/initial clause, into \<role 2> in the outer/main clause.

	That \[thing] which i see is red.    
	I_ see_  red_    
	   

	That car which I see is red.
	I_ see_ car_ red_
	   


###  (Spoken qoutes)
'' Acts as a spoken quote mark. Without a role marker Opens a quote. With a role marker closes a quote.

>  I see you  she said

The open is not needed at the beginning of a sentence.

If the role marker is '' that turns the whole quote into a "said" verb.
> peter  put your hat on 
> Peter said "put your hat on"
