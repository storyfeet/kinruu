 : l : a[l]imony
 : i : b[ee]
 : u : c[oo]
 : ð : [th]em


## Notes

1. Even though the ''/'r' Sound's similar to the ''/'al'. They occur in different places, so there should be no ambiguity.

2. Double vowels are not allowed.

3. The following diphthongs are not allowed, because they are difficult (for me) to distinguish from similar legal diphthongs.  As a result they have been removed from the font, so romanizations are given.

* dissallowed : (reason)
* ao : (au)   
* ea : (ia)
* eo : (io)
* eu : (iu)
* ua : (oa)
* ui : (oi)


3. "ii" Is also never used, instead.

4. In most cases, if it can be written it in the script, then it can fit in a word. but words will be built from roots, which may mean some combinations never exist.
