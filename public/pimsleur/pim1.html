Welcome to  (kinruu), Listen to the following conversation.

// Excuse me. Can you speak kinruu?
.    

// Sorry, Not a word.
.  .

// Do you know someone who does?
   

// No, Not one speaker exists
.   

//Ah yes, of course, thankyou.
, , . .

By the end of this lesson you will not only be able to understand this conversation, but also to take part in it. During this course make sure try to guess ahead of the speaker, and repeat whatever the speaker says in .

Let's start by learning "Excuse me":

.  Literally, "Heart foot verb", or "I'm putting my heart in my feet".

Say it after the speaker a few times.

...  ...

The name of this language is . Literally body tongue. Much of the language is built from using body parts, or items found in nature.

To talk about it as something people use, we will attach the accusative suffix "", ""

...  ...

How do you say Excuse me?

...  ...

And what is the name of this language?

...   ...

Did you notice the  at the end of the sentence, that roughly means "is". So the speaker said "It is kinruufa" "It" is implied.

Were now going to learn to say "Can speak", first the verb "To Speak"



The  is the same as the word tongue or language, and the  marks it as the infinitive "To speak"

How to you say "To speak"?

...  ...

Now "Can speak"

 

Which word means "Can"?

...  ...

Literally "Muscle verb"

Can you guess how to say "to be able to speak"

...   ...

Now, "I can speak"

  

Which word means "I"?

...  ...

The  marks  as the subject of the sentence.

Can you remember the name of this language?

 ,  

Excuse me?



How do you say "I can speak?"

  

The word for you is 

Can you guess how to say "You can speak?"

  

How about "  You can speak   "

   

   

Notice the position of the Nouns didn't matter too much, you can shift them around for emphasis as you like. But the verbs need to be together to mean "Can speak"

 has a spoken question mark pronounced  which can go at the end of any statement sentence to make it a question.

Can you guess how to say " Can you speak  "

    

Here we have put  at the beginning as it is what we are asking about.

If no other subject is obvious from context, questions are assumed to be about the person being asked, so we don't need to word "you" or . Try it:

   ?

Excuse me, Can you speak kinruu?

.    

The word for Sorry is similar to excuse me.



This is closer to my heart is already in my foot. or "Heart foot is"

A word in kinruu is a tongue child or


and "1 word" as the object of a sentence would be

 

Which of those words means "One" or "a"



not a word is :

 

How do you say "Not one word"

 

Can you try to say "I speak one word"

   

To negate a verb, before it's type you add a negative marker:



for example:



Can you try to say "I don't speak a word"

   

"I'm Sorry, I don't speak a word." "I" can be implied.

.   

In kinruu, "Person who does" is the prefix  It may or may not be followed by a verb. And is treated as a noun.

For example person who speaks or speaker:



or player



How would you say speaker or one who speaks?



If the important verb is already understood from context, you can drop it. Try it:



How do you say: "do you speak kinruu?"

  

   

    

In Kinruu, while the brain is associated with thinking, bones are associated with knowledge. To know a person is , Literally "bone, soul"



Try to say do you know someone who does, (Leaving the verb implied)

  

   

What about do you know Someone who speaks.

  

   

Here is one way to say "do you know someone who speaks kinruu"

   

Here the  is a joining particle, it means belonging to. So this means something like "kinruu's speaker, do you know?"

Try it again but this time specify who you are talking about.

    

    

Both of these sentences are correct, But in the first we care more about the speaker of kinruu, but in the second, we care more about the listener knowing.

Do you rememeber how to say "I don't speak a word"

  

Here is how to say "not one exists"

 

Here we made  or "Not one" into the subject.

Listen again:

 

What is the word for exists?



remember the  is just a verb marker.

Can you guess how you might say "no"?



A common response to new information is to say "Aaah"
This is the same in kinruu.



Here the 'A' sound is extended, did you hear it?

Do you remember how to say "Is"?



This can also be used to mean yes.

Say, "Ahh yes".

, 

The word for obvious is  . Literally Eye Sun.

To say "of course", or obviously, you can say.



or "obvious is".

How might you say, "Ah, yes, Obviously"

, , 

The last new word for todays lesson is thankyou:

.

Literally Heart Breath.

More formally   . I thank you. But commonly  is enough.

Now listen to the following conversation, the same one you heard at the beginning of this course, but now hopefully you can understand it.

// Excuse me. Can you speak kinruu?
.    

// Sorry, Not a word.
.  .

// Do you know someone who does?
   

// No, Not one speaker exists
.   

//Ah yes, of course, thankyou.
, , . .
