	<h1>Grammar - </h1>
	
<h2>Grammar Introduction</h2>
<h3>Normal structure</h3>
<p>In Kinruu, words are built from a set of roots, but the same set of roots can mean quite different things in different cases.</p>
<pre><code> (honmoi - fire grain) as a noun, represents &quot;meal&quot;, but as a verb means &quot;to cook&quot;.
</code></pre>
<p>To distinguish these, <strong>&quot;Role Markers&quot;</strong> are added to the end of words, to communicate their role in the sentence.</p>
<pre><code>  
I_ meal_ cook_
I cook the meal
</code></pre>
<p>In the above sentence:</p>
<ul>
<li> (dee) marks &quot;I&quot;/&quot;&quot; as the subject of the sentence.</li>
<li> (ta) marks the first  as the direct object and therefor a noun</li>
<li> (geh) marks the second  as a simple verb</li>
</ul>
<h3>Types of Root.</h3>
<p>In Kiruu, there are 4 Kinds of Root.</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Roots
<ul>
<li>Have a core meaning found in nature such as body parts, or natural phenomena.</li>
<li>Are often associated to a more abstract meaning such as desire, or effort.</li>
<li>Can take on several meanings in different contexts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Role markers
<ul>
<li>Always occur at the end of words.</li>
<li>Never occur at the start or in the middle of words.</li>
<li>Give the word it's job in the sentence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Modifiers
<ul>
<li>Come at the start of a word and change it's meaning.</li>
<li>Are sometimes allowed in the middle of a word.</li>
<li>Contain abstract meanings such as &quot;Plurality&quot;, &quot;Colour&quot;, &quot;Size&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Special Grammar markers.
<ul>
<li> :Clause marker.</li>
<li> :Spoken quote.</li>
<li> :Spoken question mark.</li>
<li> :Spoken Escape, allows for describing the grammar and words in Kinruu.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Word Order</h3>
<p>Normally clauses are ended in a verb. All items that belong to a verb come before it, however as the marker defines their role the exact order can be adjusted for emphasis.</p>
<h3>Double marking</h3>
<p>An item can take on multiple roles in a sentence. This is called <strong>&quot;Double marking&quot;</strong>.</p>
<pre><code> 
I_ hit_
I hit myself
</code></pre>
<p>If a verb is double marked, then everything belonging to that verb is treated as a single item in a larger sentence.</p>
<pre><code>    
I_ water_ swim_ want_
I want to swim in water.
</code></pre>
<p>In the above sentence  (I - subject) Is the active subject of both the inner and outer clauses.  It might be closer to translate as &quot;I want that I swim in water&quot;</p>
<pre><code>   
I_ you_ swim_ want_
I want that you swim
</code></pre>
<p>Here the inner  attaches to the inner verb.</p>
<h2>All Role Markers</h2>
<p>Finish a word giving the role in the sentence</p>
<h3>verbs:</h3>
<p>All sentences end with one of the following.</p>
<p>Simple: <br />

Soft Imperative (request):<br />
Hard imperative (Command):<br />
Is:<br />
Is not:</p>
<p>All other forms can be negated using  before the role</p>
<pre><code>eg: &quot;Doesn't go&quot;    
 &quot;Don't go&quot;    
</code></pre>
<p>When using  for &quot;is not&quot; the item is preceded with a </p>
<pre><code>      
I_ car_ _red_    
My car is not red    

      
I_ car_ green_

</code></pre>

<h3>Time markers.</h3>
<p>before:,
at:,
after:,</p>
<p>These marker can apply apply to verbs &quot;when I go&quot; &quot;I go&quot; or to time prases.
Time phrases begin with any of</p>
<ul>
<li>number:,  ...</li>
<li>Quantities:, , </li>
<li>that/this: ,</li>
</ul>
<p>and end in the time markers.</p>

<h2>Grammar Particles</h2>
<h3> Escape</h3>
<p>Escape (Allows referring to other roots):</p>
<h3> Question</h3>
<p>Question:</p>
<h3> goh</h3>
<p>To avoid ambiguity, sometimes it is helpful to add an &quot;inner clause&quot; start marker. This is done with </p>
<pre><code>          
I_  today_ you_ swim_ want_    
I want you to swim today.

         
I_ today_  you_ swim_ want_    
Today, I want you to swim.
</code></pre>
<p>In the second sentence, &quot;Today&quot; Applies to my desire, not to the swim, the swim can happen at any future time.</p>
<h3>That which ..</h3>
<p> is the only word that can come after a verb and still belong to it. That is because it joins an inner clause to an outer clause, performing a role like &quot;that which&quot;</p>
<p>After a verb,  has 2 role markers following it. It allows an item defined in an inner clause to be used in an outer clause.</p>
<p>This takes two forms</p>
<pre><code>a) ... verb_ _role1_role1 ... verb2    

b) ... verb_ item__role1_role2 ... verb2
</code></pre>
<p>This joins turns the item that would be &lt;role 1&gt; in the inner/initial clause, into &lt;role 2&gt; in the outer/main clause.</p>
<pre><code>That [thing] which i see is red.    
I_ see_  red_    
   

That car which I see is red.
I_ see_ car_ red_
   
</code></pre>
<h3> (Spoken qoutes)</h3>
<p>'' Acts as a spoken quote mark. Without a role marker Opens a quote. With a role marker closes a quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> I see you  she said</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The open is not needed at the beginning of a sentence.</p>
<p>If the role marker is '' that turns the whole quote into a &quot;said&quot; verb.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>peter  put your hat on 
Peter said &quot;put your hat on&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
